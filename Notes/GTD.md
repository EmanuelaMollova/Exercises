### [Getting Thigns Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)

We **(1) collect** things that command our attention; **(2) process** what they 
mean and what to do about them; and **(3) organize** the results, which we **(4)
review** as options for what we choose to **(5) do**.

1. Every open loop must be in your collection system and out of your head.
2. You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with.
3. You must empty them regularly.

THE KEY INGREDIENTS of relaxed control are:
- (1) clearly defined outcomes 
(projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and 
- (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. 

Natural Planning Techniques: The Five Phases
--------------------------------------------

### 1. Purpose

It never hurts to ask the "why?" question.Why are you going to your next 
meeting? What's the purpose of your task? Why are you having friends over 
for a barbeque in the backyard? Why are you hiring a marketing director? 
Why do you have a budget? The question "How will I know when this is 
off-purpose?" must have a clear answer.
	
### 2. Principle

"I would give others totally free rein to do this as long as they. . ."
- what? What policies, stated or unstated, will apply to your group's 
activities? 
"As long as they stayed within budget"? 
"satisfied the client"? 
"ensured a healthyteam"? 
"promoted a positive image"?
"What behavior might undermine what I'm doing, and how can I prevent it?" 
That will give you a good starting point for defining your standards.
	
### 3. Vision/Outcome

In order most productively to access the conscious and unconscious resources 
available to you, you must have a clear picture in your mind of what success 
would look, sound, and feel like. This is the "what?" instead of the "why?" 
What will this project or situation really be like when it successfully 
appears in the world?

You won't see how to do it until you see yourself doing it.

Outcome/vision can range from a simple statement of the
project, such as "Finalize computer-system implementation,"
to a completely scripted movie depicting the future scene in all
its glorious detail. Here are three basic steps for developing a
vision:

1. View the project from beyond the completion date.
2. Envision "WILD SUCCESS"! (Suspend "Yeah, but. . .")
3. Capture features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place.

Brainstorm ideas about the project:

- Don't judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize.
- Go for quantity, not quality.
- Put analysis and organization in the background.
	
### 4. Organizing

What are the things that must occur to create the final result? In what
order must they occur? What is the most important element to ensure the 
success of the project?

The Basics of Organizing

The key steps here are:
    - Identify the significant pieces.
    - Sort by (one or more):
      - components
      - sequences
      - priorities
    - Detail to the required degree.
		
### 5. Next Actions

The Basics
- Decide on next actions for each of the current moving parts of the project.
- Decide on the next action in the planning process, if necessary.

The habit of clarifying the next action on projects, no matter what the 
situation, is fundamental to you staying in relaxed control.
	
### Lists:

1. In-basket (for everything that comes up)
2. Trash
3. Someday/Maybe
4. Reference - for your reference and support information. As you come across 
   material in your in-basket and e-mail that you'd like to keep for archival or 
   support purposes, file it.
5. Waiting for (someone)
6. Pending
7. Projects

- A "Projects" list
- Project support material
- Calendared actions and information
- "Next Actions" lists
- A "Waiting For" list
- Reference material
- A "Someday/Maybe" list
	
	
### In basket:

- Think of everything that needs to be done physical - the desk, drawers, walls, 
decoration, the whole room
- Write out each thought, each idea, each project or thing that has your attention
- Look for something missing - pages 127-130

### Review in basket:

- Process the top item first.
- Process one item at a time.
- Never put anything back into "in."

On that first item, for example, do you need to call someone? Fill something 
out? Get information from the Web? Buy something at the store? Talk to your 
secretary? E-mail your boss? What? If there's an action, its specific nature 
will determine the next set of options. But what if you say, "There's really 
nothing to do with this"?

What If There Is No Action?

It's likely that a portion of your in-basket will require no action.
There will be three types of things in this category:

- Trash
- Items to incubate
- Reference material

### What If There Is Action?

- Decide what the next action is and:
  - Do it (if the action takes less than two minutes).
  - Delegate it (if you're not the most appropriate person to do the action).
  - Defer it into your organization system as an option for work to do later.

That'll be much easier if the only things in there are those that you absolutely 
have to get done on that day.

### Lists for "As soon as possible":

- "Orders"
- "Calls"
- "At Computer"
- "Errand's" - when you are out and about
- "Office Actions" or "At Office" (miscellaneous)
- "At Home"
- "Agendas" (for people and meetings)
- "Read/Review"

### Checklists:

- Personal Affirmations (i.e., personal value statements)
- Job Areas of Responsibility (key responsibility areas)
- Travel Checklist (everything to take on or do before a trip)
- Weekly Review (everything to review and/or update on a weekly basis)
- Training Program Components (all the things to handle when putting on an event, 
  front to back)
- Clients
- Conference Checklist (everything to handle when putting on a conference)
- Focus Areas (key life roles and responsibilities)
- Key People in My Life/Work (relationships to assess regularly for completion 
  and opportunity development)
- Organization Chart (key people and areas of output to manage and maintain)
- Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure personal balance 
  and progress)

### The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment:

1. Context
2. Time available
3. Energy available
4. Priority

### The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work:

- 50,000+feet: Life
- 40,000 feet: Three- to five-year visions
- 30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals
- 20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility
- 10,000 feet: Current projects
- Runway: Current actions

To consistently stay on course, you'll have to do some things that may not be 
habits yet: 
- keep everything out of your head;
- decide actions and outcomes when things first emerge on your radar, instead 
  of later; 
- regularly review and update the complete inventory of open loops of your life 
  and work
